            <h3>Day 1</h4>
            <section class="instructions">
            <p>Get a <strong>~2 liter</strong> container. This will serve as a mixing and rising vessel.</p>
            <p>Grab your <strong>scale</strong> and tare your container.</p>
            <p>Fill your container with <strong>360 grams of lukewarm water</strong> to which you will add <strong>10 to 15 grams of salt</strong>.</p>
            <p>Add <strong>~100 grams of sourdough starter</strong>. (don't have any? No biggie! <a href="#">Why not make one?</a>)</p>
            <p>Mix well until the starter has completely dissolved.</p>
            <p>Add <strong>~500 grams of flour</strong> and mix until you have a dough that is mostly free of dry, floury spots.</p>
            <p>Cover your container with cling-wrap so reduce moisture loss and set aside.</p>
            <strong>⏰ About 30 minutes later...</strong>
            <p>Drip some water over a clean surface and spread the water with your hands so that a surface about as big as a cutting board is uniformly soaked. Make sure your hands are also wet.</p>
            <p>Take the dough out of its container.</p>
            <p>Flatten the dough over the wet surface and fold in twice in half. <strong>Repeat this thrice.</strong>
            <p>After the third time, put the dough back in its container. It's ready to rise. Put the cling-wrap over your container.</p>
            <strong>⏰Let the dough rest and rise for two to three days...</strong>

            <p>Once the oven is nice and ready, take your container out of there.</p>
            <p>Gently transfer your dough from its rising vessel to the hot baking container.</p>
